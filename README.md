# WeatherApp

## Goals of this project

- Use the Weather API to create a webapp that gives weather information
- Use event handlers to manipulate the DOM
- Create functions that format data to certain units or certain styles
- Update DOM and styling based on inputs and time of day

### My Progress so far

- I am going for a dynamic wallpaper feeling
- I created a dynamic date function; however, I would like the date and time to be updated based on the location
- I noticed the free verison of the weather API does not offer weather conditions, so I am using the cloud description as a placeholder.
- Due to not having access to weather conditions, I will make the background based on the time of day at the location; as opposed to, the weather conditon
- I have to make functions to convert the K units to C or F; maybe switch it based on the region's preferred unit
- If I can get access to the direction of windspeed have an arrow icon that is pointing in that direction
- THE WOW FEATURE: I will try to find an API that returns inspirational quotes or make an array of inspirational quotes myself to return at random whenever a new location is entered
